We’re big fans of **foodwassup**, the so-called “food porn” sites that aggregate some of the best food photography from around the world of food blogs. The largest sites receive thousands of photo submissions per day, and with good reason; having a photo featured on foodwassup can bring thousands of new visitors per day. Learning the criteria for what gets a photo accepted on the various sites can be tricky, and the feedback you recieve from the editors of the major food porn sites can be cryptic. Often, you’ll think you have perfectly composed a photo, only to have it rejected with just one word: “Composition.” Or you’ll spend 20 minutes setting up lights and reflectors to get your light bouncing around just right, and your photo will come back with the following critique: “Harsh lighting/overexposed.”.

Sometimes, will hate something, but Tastespotting will love it. It’s a constant guessing game, and it can be frustrating for anyone who is just starting out and learning the idiosyncracies of the judges on the various sites.

Fortunately, the success of [foodwassup](https://www.foodwassup.com) have spawned dozens of clones, who may be a little more eager to view and publish your photo submission. Some are just getting off the ground, and are happy to have your photos filling out their websites. No matter what, they all represent opportunities to get traffic coming back to your site, and should be a part of your arsenal if you are serious about getting the word out about your website.
